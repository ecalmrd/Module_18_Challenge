## Description  
Using Express.js for routing and Mongoose ODM with a MongoDB database, I developed an API for a social network web application that enables users to share their thoughts, react, and form a friend list. Update features are in a work of progress.


## Installation
In VS Code, start a new terminal in the root directory of the project. Run NPM I to install the dependencies. Then run NPM seed to insert the seed into the DB. Finally, enter NPM start to run the application to your local server and use Insomnia to test the application.
